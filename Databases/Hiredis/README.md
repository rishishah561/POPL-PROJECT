# PoPL Aspects of Hiredis

## Low-Level Redis Interaction:
Hiredis is a C library that provides a simple and direct interface to interact with Redis. The C++ code uses Hiredis for establishing a connection (redisContext) and sending commands (redisCommand) to the Redis server. This low-level interaction allows fine-grained control over Redis communication.

## Manual Memory Management:
The C++ code employs manual memory management using functions like malloc and free for allocating and freeing memory. This approach requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks or undefined behavior, reflecting the flexibility and responsibility provided by low-level C++ programming.

## C++ Redis Client Integration:
The code integrates Hiredis seamlessly into a C++ application, demonstrating the compatibility and interoperability between C and C++ languages. This integration enables C++ developers to leverage the capabilities of the Hiredis library within a C++ codebase.
