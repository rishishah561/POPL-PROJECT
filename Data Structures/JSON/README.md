# PoPL Aspect of JSON

## Ownership and Resource Management:
The json object, representing the parsed JSON data, takes ownership of the parsed data. The ownership model in the nlohmann::json library ensures proper resource management, including memory allocated for the parsed JSON structure.

## Error Handling with Result Type:
The code utilizes a try-catch block for error handling during JSON parsing. The use of the json::parse method returns a json object wrapped in a Result type. In case of an error, an exception is caught, and the error message is printed, demonstrating explicit error handling.

## Traits and Abstractions:
The nlohmann::json library provides a high-level abstraction for JSON manipulation, representing JSON objects as instances of the json type. This aligns with the concept of using traits or types for abstraction, making it easier to work with JSON data in a strongly typed manner.
