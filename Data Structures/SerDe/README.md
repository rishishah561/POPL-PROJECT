# PoPL Aspect of SerDe

## Type Annotations and Structs:
The code utilizes Rust's strong static typing, and the WebTrafficData struct with explicit type annotations reflects a clear definition of the expected structure of the JSON data. This adherence to strong typing enhances code reliability and prevents type-related errors.

## Error Handling:
The code incorporates comprehensive error handling using Rust's Result type. This aligns with Rust's emphasis on managing errors explicitly, providing a clear indication of success or failure during the deserialization process. This approach enhances the robustness and reliability of the code.


## Ownership and Borrowing:
Rust's ownership and borrowing system is implicitly present in the code, with the ownership of the JSON string being transferred to the serde_json::from_str function during deserialization. This demonstrates Rust's memory safety guarantees and its ability to prevent data races and other memory-related issues.

## Pattern Matching:
The use of pattern matching in the match statement during error handling showcases Rust's pattern-matching capabilities. Pattern matching is a powerful feature that enhances code expressiveness and conciseness, contributing to better readability and maintainability.

These aspects collectively highlight how Rust, in conjunction with the Serde framework, incorporates language design principles to achieve safer, more reliable, and expressive code for web trafficÂ analysis.
