# Comparison betweeen JSON and SerDe

## Safety:
Rust (SerDe):
Rust's ownership system and borrow checker contribute to memory safety, preventing common programming errors.
Type safety is enforced, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

C++ (JSON for Modern C++):
C++ provides flexibility but may require careful manual memory management, potentially leading to memory-related errors.
The use of exceptions for error handling introduces a runtime safety mechanism, but it can also introduce complexity.

## CPU Utilization and Performance:

Rust (SerDe):
Rust's ownership system may contribute to efficient CPU utilization and performance.
The automatic derivation of traits by Serde may result in optimized and performant code.

C++ (JSON for Modern C++):
C++ allows for low-level optimizations and manual memory management, potentially contributing to efficient CPU utilization.
The use of exceptions might introduce some runtime overhead, impacting performance.

## Scalability:

Rust (SerDe):
Rust's ownership system can aid in writing concurrent and scalable code.
The borrow checker helps prevent data races and ensures thread safety.

C++ (JSON for Modern C++):
C++ offers manual control over threading and scalability, allowing developers to tailor the implementation to specific requirements.
Scalability depends on the design decisions made during implementation.
