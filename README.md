# POPL-PROJECT
TITLE: Real-Time Web Traffic Analysis and Comparative Evaluation in Rust & C++

The project involves a systematic approach to implementing real-time web traffic analyzers in both Rust and C++, showcasing the importance of language-specific features and design principles.
The comparison between Actix-Web and Boost.Beast, Redis-Rs and Hiredis, Log and Env_logger, Serde and JSON for Modern C++ highlights how language-specific principles influence the development of high-performance systems. The project implicitly explores concepts such as concurrency models, memory management, type systems, and error handling strategies present in Rust and C++. Analyzing the actual results, performance metrics, reliability, safety, and security evaluations also provides insights into the practical application of these principles in real-world scenarios.
This is the first time someone has used RUST AND/OR CPP libraries and made their real time comaparision
