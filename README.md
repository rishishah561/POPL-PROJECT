TITLE: Real-Time Web Traffic Analysis and Comparative Evaluation in Rust & C++

The project involves a systematic approach to implementing real-time web traffic analyzers in both Rust and C++, showcasing the importance of language-specific features and design principles.
The comparison between Actix-Web and Boost.Beast, Redis-Rs and Hiredis, Log and Env_logger, Serde and JSON for Modern C++ highlights how language-specific principles influence the development of high-performance systems. The project implicitly explores concepts such as concurrency models, memory management, type systems, and error handling strategies present in Rust and C++. Analyzing the actual results, performance metrics, reliability, safety, and security evaluations also provides insights into the practical application of these principles in real-world scenarios.
This is the first time someone has used RUST AND/OR CPP libraries and made their real time comaparision.


Our solution differentiates itself by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between real-time web traffic analyzers implemented in Rust and C++. We specifically focus on industry-standard libraries such as Actix-Web vs. Boost.Beast, Redis-Rs vs. Hiredis, Log/Env_logger vs. spdlog and Serde vs JSON. This approach provides a nuanced understanding of performance, reliability, and security aspects, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making in deploying high-performance real-time data systems.

Our research never required the use of any external hardware any architectural componenets as its a software based comparision and how efficient the libraries are in its implementation.
The testing componenet which we have used is VTUNE.
Vtune is a performance profiling tool developed by Intel, commonly used in software development to analyze and optimize the performance of applications by identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
Vtune's integration into our codebase significantly enhances our ability to conduct comprehensive and efficient performance analysis.
Our project never required us to use an external database since its jsut a comparative analysis of different libraries and frameworks in Rust and C++.

Given more time, extending the project to design a custom web framework for real-time traffic analysis on the college's official website would be a valuable future endeavor. This involves incorporating language-specific principles from Rust or C++, such as concurrency, performance optimizations, and safety features, into the development of the web framework. Additionally, collaborating with the developers' society and contributing to the college's technology infrastructure aligns with principles of community engagement and practical application of programming language concepts in a real-world setting.
